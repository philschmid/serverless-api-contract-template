# Serverless API Contract - Template

## Definition

API Contract is the documentation of the API. This document is the place where you declare how your API will behave, it includes de endpoints urls, the actions of each endpoint, arguments, examples of the responses and any other detail, the development team think it is interesting to be documented.

There are several file format that allow you to create a contract and obtain your documentation (or mock server, automated tests, etc.). The most common today is an OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger).

The contract is defined by the providers of the service and destined for the consumers of the API, in other words, for the companies and developers that will use the API. The document is usually created by the development team. If a developer has the complete domain knowledge he could be able to compose the documentation alone. Otherwise he might need the help of some domain expert.
